PhonoAlign
===================

Generates phonologically aware alignments of morphologically related forms; extracts useful information from those alignments

## Current goal:
Use SLL-style hypothesis distillation to improve alignments

## Additional goals:
1. Generate counts of segment--segment mappings
2. Create an alignment mode that separates stem from affix


# Credits
Based on the aligner used in the Allen & Becker Sublexical Learner ( http://sublexical.phonologist.org/ ), which was in turn based on Peter Kleiweg's Levenshtein demo ( http://www.let.rug.nl/~kleiweg/lev/ ).
