PhonoAlign
===================

Generates phonologically aware alignments of morphologically related forms; extracts useful information from those alignments


# TODO
## Short term:
1. Generate counts of segment--segment mappings
2. Create an alignment mode that separates stem from affix

## Longer term:
1. Use SLL-style hypothesis distillation to improve alignments


# Credits
Based on the aligner used in the Allen & Becker Sublexical Learner (** location **), which was in turn based on Peter Kleiweg's Levenshtein demo ( http://www.let.rug.nl/~kleiweg/lev/ ).
