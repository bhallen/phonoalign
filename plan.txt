How can the "correct" alignments of all the following cases be produced by the same system?

b u x _ _
b y c e r
NOT: b _ _ y c e r / b u x _ _ _ _

k o e r u _ _
k o e _ _ t a
(or the opposite)
NOT: [r]~[t] and [u]~[a]

y o m u _ _ _ _ _
y o m _ i m a s u
(or maybe [u]~[i] + suffix?)
NOT: infixation of [mas]
